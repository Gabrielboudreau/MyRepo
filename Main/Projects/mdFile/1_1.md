# Assignment 1.1 - Sorting

## Flowchart

## Why?

I chose bubble sort due to the lack of complexity required for the project. Bubble sort is easy to implement and works well

## Challenges

I wanted to implement a way to shift the numbers iterating from lowest to highest as well but I couldn't figure out how to do that without rewriting new loops.
