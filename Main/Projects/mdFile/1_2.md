## How would I do this on a website?

I would have another method iterate through every word on the site and convert it into a String element in an array. I could then perform my algorithm on that array. 

## Challenges

.toLowerCase seemed to break everything every time I tried to implement it. I'm still not sure why but I got it to work and be case insensitive by the end.
